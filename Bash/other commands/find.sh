# To find files with specific permissions
find /path/to/search -perm mode
# Delete All .tmp Files
find /path/to/search -name "*.tmp" -exec rm {} \;

-exec: Execute a command on each file found
{}: Each time find identifies a file, it replaces {} with the fileâ€™s path.
\;: This signifies the end of the -exec command. The backslash (\) is necessary to escape the semicolon (;)
so that itâ€™s passed correctly to find rather than being interpreted by the shell.
